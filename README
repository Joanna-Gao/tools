CreateVectors:

	This script creates vector files for different types of events.
	Run it using the command 
		root -l CreateVectors.C

	The output will be files named VectorFileFC.dat for FC events etc.

Vector.mac

	This is an example mac file on how to use the vector files to simulate events.

llib.C:

	This file is used to load the libraries required to read WCSim outputs.

ODAnalysis.C

	This script runs a clustering algorithm on a WCSim output event. 
	Run it using the command
		root -l llib.C 'ODAnalysis.C("WCSim.root","outputFile.root",false)'

	This script is a work in progress, currently has some hard-coded values which will need to be changed to be more general.
	Also needs tuning.
