tools/

	This file contains tool scripts used before or after the running simulation. 


	For creating randomised vertices of muons on the tank cavern or other places, go to Vertex/
	The folder contains script that creates vector files for different types of events.
	To run it, go to Vertex-build and use command 
		./CreateVectors

	The output will be files named VectorFileFC.dat for FC events etc.
	To change the type of event, go into the file and edit main() at the very end.

Vector.mac

	This is an example mac file on how to use the vector files to simulate events.

llib.C:

	This file is used to load the libraries required to read WCSim outputs.

ODAnalysis.C

	This script runs a clustering algorithm on a WCSim output event. 
	Run it using the command
		root -l llib.C 'ODAnalysis.C("WCSim.root","outputFile.root",false)'

	This script is a work in progress, currently has some hard-coded values which will need to be changed to be more general.
	Also needs tuning.
